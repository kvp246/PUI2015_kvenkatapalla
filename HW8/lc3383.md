##Review:
The plot is quite straight forward to read with easy to understand labeling of axes, title and source. Specially the choice of font size is optimal and comes on nicely to the eyes. X axis is shown in sorted fashion implementing the steady increase in years but did not include the label which makes us to guess, and sensible one would be the years looking at the title. One thing misleading though is the total value of spending represented as points across the Y axis. This is slightly confusing and best way would have been using additional Y axis, and country labeling could have been done using legend box. On the esthetic lines, definitely choice of colors and overall plot representation is quite good except the use of similar colors for both south central america and africa. Also the line refering to oceania continent is almost invisible or is in complete sync with africa line making it harder to interpret the values. The choice of lines for showcasing varying trends across continents is a good one, and overall this looks like an apt choice for the data being represented.

Alternatively, a better choice of plot would have been using stacked bar plot representing the percentages and the total spending in billions of dollars as a line with additional Y axis. The names of the continents can be represented through a legend box.
