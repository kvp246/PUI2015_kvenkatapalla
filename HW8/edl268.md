##Review:

This plot is simple to read with good choice of font size and clear representation of axes, title and legend. Trends being captured in this plot are easy to interpret. On esthetic lines, the choice of plot type (i.e. line) and colors is qutie nice and they bring out the best from the data. However, the thickness of lines shown could have been better controled for as the current value seems to mix up lines at the top for latin america and southeast asia. Also the choice of colors is not color blind compatible which can be improved upon. Inspite of these, this plot representation of the given data is a very good choice and the trends are quite clear which can be observed through a similar trend showcased by regions in literary % for the years 1995 and 2015. Clealy something is causing this similar pattern to occur in these regions which can be further explored but the plot is playing its role excellently in bringing out this trend.
