your reviewes were insightful and on point 10/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

nice color choice: avoiding blue and pink/red for male female is a good idea to avoid triggering preconceptions

robust to color blindness

low resolution (typical of seaborn) is questionable (remember tufte's rules)

labels too small

legend too small

refer to gende, not sex.

the artificial lower limit to the age gives the odd all equal upper quartile, and should be explained in the caption or in a text
